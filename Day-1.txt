# An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a data type that defines what operations are performed on data and what their behavior is, without specifying how the operations are implemented.

# Elements of Stack ADT

1. Push - IF stack size is limited, then the stack size get overflow.
2. Pop - If stack gets empty, after that the stack gets underflow.
3. Size - Tells the size of the stack.
4. Empty - Tells If The stack is empty or not. And Returns Boolian value.
5. Peev - Tells the top most value.

# Algorithm is a finite, step-by-step set of well-defined instructions used to solve a problem or perform a computation.

# Write the algorithm to find out the marks of the toppers

1. Input marks
2. Take first stu mark as max marks
3. compare maxmarks and next student marks
4. if maxmarks>next student marks ---- max marks = next student marks ------ else pass
5. print maxmarks
